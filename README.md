# App for discovering new music

Music profile app to keep track of bands you want to listen to, top new music, events (coming soon), and keeps track of favorites on your profile page.


User story: nu.notes is an app that keeps track of users' music preferences and serves as a landing page to keep track of new music on a single page. The user can also enter a mood and it will return artists that relate to that mood.

What I want to implement in the future: The eventful API to display events in the area depending on geolocation, Itunes/Spotify/ or Soundcloud API, and related artists from the already-used Echonest API.
